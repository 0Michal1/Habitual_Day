# Habitual_Day
Habitual Day is a project to create and manage habits. We can construct a list of general habits broken down into categories and types. Based on them, everyone can create their personalized habit and confirm its implementation daily, therefore creating a "habit" of performing it every day. There is also a method that checks daily your activity and resets your streak when it is not there.

## Project characteristics:

*The project is created in Java with Spring Boot and Hibernate.

*It is being built according to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture with a clean and complete separation of the user interface, business logic and database repositories. The advantage is that the code has a transparent structure.

*What is Done: Scheduled method to check the daily confirmation of the habit.
The possibility of logging in, to create new general habits, new categories and create your personalized habit and confirm your performance by prolonging your streak.

## What am I working on now:

*Adding new functions to the application (deleting, editing, etc.).

*Writing unit tests for this application.

*The visual sphere of the application (I left it for the end because I am focusing on the application engine, the backend)
